To do list TMS70C02 Monitor

- fix Gaaaa (jump) and Caaaa (call)
- refactor RAM test code; abstract the phase 2, 3, 4 code to a generic
  routine.
- implement backspace on the collect routine as rudimentary edit feature
- implement a 'previous command line' retrieval key (up-arrow?)
- actually implement the hex-intel code.
