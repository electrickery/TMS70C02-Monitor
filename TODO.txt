To do list TMS70C02 Monitor

- debug the RAM test
- refactor RAM test code; abstract the phase 2, 3, 4 code to a generic
  routine.
- refactor the address extraction from the command line buffer to a 
  generic routine like THIRDADR but better
- implement backspace on the collect routine as rudimentary edit feature
- implement a 'previous command line' retrieval key (up-arrow?)
- actually implement the hex-intel code.
